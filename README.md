# School District Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide insights about spending and performance for a school district. The aggregated data includes information on school funding and student standardized tests scores. These insights are to aid the school board in making decisions based on budgets and educational priorities. The original analysis includes data for all students within the district. Recent evidence suggests the reading and math scores for Thomas High School ninth graders is compromised. The analysis was run again, and is now available without the compromised data.

## Results

The following results are a comparison between the original analysis and the analysis performed after the compromised data was removed. For complete detail on the analysis, refer to the analysis script.
